=========

Just a ORMapper for DB-Types. We don't need NoSQL.

Works at that very moment with PostgreSQL (>= 8.4 tested). Should later work with any database supporting user defined types.

Currently working out the unit tests. Stay tuned...

Already productive at http://www.bundesligaboerse.eu/ - just for the mass testing :D
