typernate
=========

Just a typesafe ORMapper for DB-Types written in Java. We don't need NoSQL.

Works at that very moment with PostgreSQL (>= 8.4 tested). Should later work with any database supporting user defined types.

Currently working out the unit tests... - and of course the tuts. Stay tuned...

Already productive at http://www.bundesligaboerse.eu/ - just for the mass testing :D
